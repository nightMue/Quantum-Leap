# Quantum Leap

This is a Flutter/Dart implementation of a Quantum Gate Game

Below is the my implementation of a shoebox design. I have changed a few things. All that is left if to implement the Flare animatino for the box opening/closing but I do not have the Adobe After Effects animation file to import into Flare.
